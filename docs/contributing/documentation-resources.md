# Documentation Resources
## External Resources

Our documentation is built on [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Both Material and MkDocs provide extensive documentation of their own:

* [Material Documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/)
* [MkDocs Documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)

MkDocs utilizes Markdown, a simple text formatting language. Many resources exist online to teach the basics of Markdown, there's even an interactive [Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) that can be completed in about 10 minutes.

Markdown tables can be a bit of hassle to create manually, but a handy tool is available to help: [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#).

## Enabled Features
