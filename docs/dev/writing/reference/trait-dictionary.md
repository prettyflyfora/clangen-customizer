## **Personality Traits**

A *personality trait* in ClanGen is a single-word trait that dictates how a cat may behave in some circumstances. Personality traits open the door for writers of ClanGen to add more varied thoughts, events, and patrols. A *nervous* or *bloodthirsty* cat might be more likely to have an interaction with a Clanmate that skews *negatively,* while a *loving* or *wise* cat might skew more *positively.* That's not an end-all-be-all, though, and traits are expected to show both *negative* and *positive* qualities in their interactions. A majority of ClanGen thoughts, events, and patrols are *not* trait-constrained, and any cat can experience them.

Pop-culture references may not be 100% accurate, but serve as a basic guideline. The *descriptor* sentences beneath each trait as well as the *facets* (read below) are more accurate to the traits. If you have any questions, ask the team.

### **How Facets Reflect on the Trait**

Facets can be found [here (github.com)](https://github.com/ClanGenOfficial/clangen/blob/development/resources/dicts/traits/trait_ranges.json). Facets operate on a range of 0-16.  0 is low. 16 is high. 8 can be considered a midpoint.

**Lawfulness**

* **Low**: “I put little stock in rules, both my internal rules and the rules of those around me. I am quick to shrug off possible consequences.”  
* **High**: “I am strict in how I interface with the society I live within. I put a lot of stock in a moral code, though that code may be personal and private or society-wide and well-known.”  


**Sociability**

* **Low**: “I struggle to navigate the social web around me and may struggle to understand what makes others tick.”
* **High**: “I’m savvy in conversation and have a great understanding of how other cats think and behave.”


**Aggression**

* **Low**: “I am slow to confront both other cats and my own beliefs. I might act cautiously and may struggle to assert myself.”  
* **High**: “I assert myself in all I do, making my opinions clear and rarely waiting to consider what other cats want.”


**Stability**

* **Low**: “I am quick to change my opinions and make decisions. I don’t spend much time considering the consequences of what I do.”  
* **High**: “I am slow to change my opinions and make decisions. I’m consistent and grounded."
