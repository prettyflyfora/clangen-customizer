# Project Basics
## Contributing to ClanGen
ClanGen is an open-source project, and anyone can contribute to it by making a pull request. Everyone who created a PR which was also merged will get the `developer` role in our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/clangen). 

Another way for people to join the team is through applying to become an apprentice developer. Apprentice developers will have access to the dev channels on discord and will be able to consult with other developers. They will be promoted to full developers upon the acceptance of a PR. We detail the expectations of active developers in [Development Team Roles](development-team-roles.md).

!!! important
    Remember, because ClanGen is open-source and collaborative, contributors must be comfortable with their work being modified or removed without notice. While we make efforts to ensure contributors are properly notified of such action and given opportunity to modify their own work, there is no guarantee of such notification.
